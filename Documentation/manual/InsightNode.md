# Insight Node

The TrainAR Insight nodes may be used to show additional insights, hints or tips to the user. Textual insights can also be given in combination with a soundfile (e.g. for voice recordings) and an image may be specified in this node. This could for example be the "expert" providing the insights.

From the didactic perspective, this is intended to be used to provide additional insights or tips from experience/practise to the user: Telling the user how this would look in practice, telling the user what he should be careful about when training this procedure in real life. It is not intended to provide direct feedback or new instructions to the user. For more detail, read our publication on the TrainAR interaction concept and didactic framework: ["TrainAR: A Scalable Interaction Concept and Didactic Framework for Procedural Trainings Using Handheld Augmented Reality"](https://www.mdpi.com/2414-4088/5/7/30)
