# Instruction Node

With the Instruction node, authors can update the text and the progress percentage on the top panel shown at the top of the smartphone screen. Consequently, authors can specify the instruction text and the progress percentage in the node.

From the didactic perspective, this is intended to be used to provide instructions to the user of the training: Telling the user what to do next. For more detail, read our publication on the TrainAR interaction concept and didactic framework: ["TrainAR: A Scalable Interaction Concept and Didactic Framework for Procedural Trainings Using Handheld Augmented Reality"](https://www.mdpi.com/2414-4088/5/7/30)
